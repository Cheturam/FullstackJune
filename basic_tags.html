<br><strong>Strong tag< used for presentation</strong>
<br><b>Bold tag used for semantic behavior</b>
<div>Strong and bold explaination: <br>
"strong" means "stronger emphasis", and implies no particular visual style. It has semantic meaning, but by default a browser could style it to look like anything, not just bold. On the other hand, "b" literally means 'make this text bold', without any attached meaning.</div>
